# frontend-workspace
This repository contains all the frontend related projects I am working on. This is a practice space so this is not a single project repo but contains a bunch of projects at the same time. The projects are separated by folders. This may seem confusing on commit messages but I will be working on one project at a time for the commit messages not to get messed up.
